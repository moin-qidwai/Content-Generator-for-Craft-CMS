This is a paint program for collaborative painting over a network by multiple users.


DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
---------------------

This is a program that provides a simple interface for painting with your friends over a network. Multiple users can connect at the same time and what one user paints will be immediately send to all users connected to the server. The program can be run as both server and client. One user must be the server (although he/she can run the program as a client themself as well) while others are clients.
